<!-- belowing write introduction of this category -->

trik1 is a newly created category that will hold all the related tutorials under it. Each tutorial content is contained in a `t-` prefixed directory, and 3 default sections of the tutorial in it.

For convinence and overal capability show, category/tutorial generator includes something that you may feel unrelated to your content, its doesnt matter, just open the cagegory/tutorial source `.md` file like `index.md` or `1-stone.md` with your favorite text editor, modify anything displayed in webpage.

But, one rule need to be kept in mind, you are NOT allowed to modify anything before the colons in .md file! The words before(or left) the `:` are the preserved defintion which act as a key to use/reference in software inner logic. If you intentionly modify them, the application will stop to work as your expectation.
